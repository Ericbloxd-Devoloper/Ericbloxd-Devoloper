# 👋 Hello! I'm Ercbloxd

### 🚀 Solo Roblox Developer & intermediate Luau Engineer

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I'm an independent game developer with a deep passion for the Roblox platform. As a solo creator, I manage the entire development pipeline—from the initial concept and game design to full-stack Luau scripting, UI/UX implementation, and performance optimization.

My mission is to build high-quality, immersive, and fun experiences that push the boundaries of what's possible on Roblox.

### 💡 What I Do as a Solo Developer

Being a one-person team means I wear many hats. I thrive on the challenge of bringing a complete vision to life.

* **Game Design:** Crafting core gameplay loops, systems, and mechanics.
* **Luau Scripting:** Architecting secure and efficient client-server systems.
* **Data Management:** Implementing robust data persistence using DataStoreService (and modules like ProfileService).
* **3D Assets:** Modeling and texturing basic assets in **Blender** and integrating them into Studio.
* **Optimization:** Debugging, profiling, and optimizing scripts and assets for all platforms (PC, Mobile, Console).
